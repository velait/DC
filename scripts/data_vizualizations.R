# Challenges
# Boxplots are useful summaries, but hide the shape of the distribution. For example, if the distribution is bimodal, we would not see it in a boxplot. An alternative to the boxplot is the violin plot, where the shape (of the density of points) is drawn.

ggplot(surveys_complete, aes(y=weight, x=species_id)) + geom_violin() + scale_y_log10()

# In many types of data, it is important to consider the scale of the observations. For example, it may be worth changing the scale of the axis to better distribute the observations in the space of the plot. Changing the scale of the axes is done similarly to adding/modifying other components (i.e., by incrementally adding commands). Try making these modifications:
#   Represent weight on the log10 scale; see scale_y_log10().
   
ggplot(surveys_complete, aes(y=weight, x=species_id)) + geom_violin() + scale_y_log10()

# So far, weâ€™ve looked at the distribution of weight within species. Try making a new plot to explore the distribution of another variable within each species.
 
# Create a boxplot for hindfoot_length. Overlay the boxplot layer on a jitter layer to show actual measurements.
# Add color to the data points on your boxplot according to the plot from which the sample was taken (plot_id).

# With all of this information in hand, please take another five minutes to either improve one of the plots generated in this exercise or create a beautiful graph of your own. Use the RStudio ggplot2 cheat sheet for inspiration. Here are some ideas:
#   See if you can change the thickness of the lines.
# Can you find a way to change the name of the legend? What about its labels?
#   Try using a different color palette (see http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/).
